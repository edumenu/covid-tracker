#### Example:  

This was a side project I created during the Covid 19 outbreak. I created this project for people to use and track Covid 19 cases all over the world.  

I built this project by using `create-react-app` boilerplate, then I installed tailwindcss to build the UI (I used this link https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/02/tailwindcss-react-project/ for settting up tailwindcss on react). The technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router, JSX, and tailwindCSS.
